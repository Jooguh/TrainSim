# TrainSim
Train Simulation

Programmed in C++ a simulation for a train unloading dock which simulated train
arrivals, unloading, departure, and their crewsâ€™ clocking in/out of work.

The simulation had to account for crews clocking out of work and unmanned trains waiting for new crews before resuming activity.
